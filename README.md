# Description
This repository contains multiple projects that center on the analysis of data from customers of a local supermarket. The success of most retailers is dependent on their ability to meet the needs of their customers while also personalizing the shopping experience to ensure customers relate positively with the supermarket brand. Beyond analysis of the normal customer data and behavior, this project entails:

ii. Building a recommender system (Transaction association analysis).

iii. Building an anomaly detection model (Anomaly detection).
